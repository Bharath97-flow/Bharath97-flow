## Hi, I'm Bharath

I work on **Embedded software systems** and enjoy building real projects that teach me how systems actually work.  
My goal is to write clean code, understand fundamentals deeply, and contribute to meaningful software and hardware projects.

- C
- Zephyr RTOS
- Linux  
- Communication protocols such as I2C, SPI, CAN and UART
- Perphiral configurations of a Microcontroller

- **Notes:** Focused on less usage of stack memory, debouncing and real time data delivery  

### Least significant bit image Steganography
- **What it is:** Data encoding and decoding by manipulating the LSB of a image  
- **Tech:** C, Bit manipulation and File handling 
- **Code:** https://github.com/Bharath97-flow/PROJECT-PORTFOLIO/tree/main/Stegnography
- **Notes:** Implemented efficient file handling and gained good memory manipulation ability

### Minishell implementation
- **What it is:** Address management system 
- **Tech:** C

## What I'm Learning Right Now
- Bluetooth Low Energy Stack Analysis in Zephyr RTOS 
- Zephyr RTOS
- Linux internals  

---

## How I Work
- I write code that I can explain to my future self.
- I prefer small, focused commits.
- I believe in reading documentation first, then the source.
- I treat side projects like real projects (readme, design notes, clarity).
